      "content": "25 is the third studio album recorded by British singer and songwriter Adele. It was released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21, she had planned to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.\n\nPrior to the album's release, 25 was listed as one of the most anticipated albums of 2015. Billboard, Fuse, SMH and numerous others placed the album at number one on their list, with the latter stating \"if Adele releases her third album in 2015, she could dominate the year.\" Prior to the album's official announcement, music journalists and fans speculated that the album would be titled 25 continuing the age theme from Adele's previous releases 19 and 21.\n\nOn the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, \"Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year,\" was interpreted by outlets including the Billboard and Capital FM as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year.\n\nA release date for 25 was first suggested in early August 2014, when Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015. However, accounts filed by Adele's label XL Recordings in October 2014 ruled out the possibilities of a 2014 release. In August 2015, Billboard reported that Adele's label had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November 2015. In October 2015, the album was speculated to be released on 20 November 2015, after which numerous journalists speculated that other musicians had pushed back their albums in order to avoid chart competition with her, with artists such as Justin Bieber, Sam Smith and One Direction releasing their albums before Adele's, so that their sales and chart placements would not be affected.\n\nOn 18 October, a 30-second clip of \"Hello\" was shown on UK television during a commercial break on The X Factor. It teased a new song from Adele after three years, with viewers hearing her singing the first verse of \"Hello\" with its lyrics appearing on a black screen. It was seen by an estimated 13.4 million people. Three days later, Adele released a letter to her fans through social media addressing the album, in which she confirmed that the album would be titled 25.\n\nAdele stated that the title is a reflection on her age and the frame of mind she was in during that age, describing the time as a \"turning point\" where she was in the centre of adolescence and adulthood and the start of a time where she would \"go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk.\" Adele confirmed the next day 25 would be released on 20 November 2015 and revealed its cover simultaneously on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe lead single, \"Hello\", was released on 23 October 2015 and became a critical and commercial success, with the single becoming a worldwide number one hit in 16 countries.\n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for \"Album of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for her album \"25\", as well as \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\" for \"Hello\" from the same album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/25\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
